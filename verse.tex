Life's like
%\settowidth{\versewidth}{Life's like a mayonnaise soda}
\begin{verse}
Life's like a mayonnaise soda\\
And life's like space without room\\ 
And life's like bacon and ice cream\\ 
That's what life's like without you\\
Life's like forever becoming \\
But life's forever dealing in hurt\\ 
Now life's like death without living\\ 
That's what life's like without you\\
Life's like Sanskrit read to a pony \\
I see you in my mind's eye strangling on your tongue \\
What good is knowing such devotion \\
I've been around, I know what makes things run \\
What good is seeing eye chocolate \\
What good's a computerized nose \\
And what good was cancer in April\\
Why no good, no good at all\\
What good's a war without killing\\ 
What good is rain that falls up \\
What good's a disease that won't hurt you \\
Why no good, I guess, no good at all\\
What good are these thoughts that I'm thinking \\
It must be better not to be thinking at all \\
A Styrofoam lover with emotions of concrete \\
No not much, not much at all\\
What's good is life without living \\
What good's this lion that barks \\
You loved a life others throw away nightly \\
It's not fair, not fair at all\\
What's good? \\
Not much at all\\
What's good? \\
Life's good \\
But not fair at all\\

"Badlands"
%\settowidth{\versewidth}{Lights out tonight,}
\begin{verse}
Lights out tonight,\\
Trouble in the heartland,\\
Got a head on collision,\\
Smashin' in my guts, man,\\
I'm caught in a cross fire,\\
That I don't understand,\\
But there's one thing I know for sure, girl,\\
I don't give a damn\\
For the same old played out scenes,\\
Baby, I don't give a damn\\
For just the in-betweens,\\
Honey, I want the heart, I want the soul,\\
I want control right now,\\
You better listen to me, baby\\

Talk about a dream,\\
Try to make it real\\
You wake up in the night,\\
With a fear so real,\\
You spend your life waiting,\\
For a moment that just don't come,\\
Well, don't waste your time waiting,\\

Badlands, you gotta live it everyday,\\
Let the broken hearts stand\\
As the price you've gotta pay,\\
We'll keep pushin' 'til it's understood,\\
And these badlands start treating us good.\\

Workin' in the fields\\
'til you get your back burned,\\
Workin' 'neath the wheels\\
'til you get your facts learned,\\
Baby, I got my facts\\
Learned real good right now,\\
You better get it straight, darlin'\\
Poor man wanna be rich,\\
Rich man wanna be king,\\
And a king ain't satisfied,\\
'til he rules everything,\\
I wanna go out tonight,\\
I wanna find out what I got\\

Well, I believe in the love that you gave me,\\
I believe in the faith that can save me,\\
I believe in the hope and I pray,\\
That someday it may raise me\\
Above these badlands\\

Badlands, you gotta live it everyday,\\
Let the broken hearts stand\\
As the price you've gotta pay,\\
We'll keep pushin' 'til it's understood,\\
And these badlands start treating us good.\\

For the ones who had a notion, a notion deep inside,\\
That it ain't no sin to be glad you're alive\\
I wanna find one face that ain't looking through me\\
I wanna find one place,\\
I wanna spit in the face of these...\\

Badlands, you gotta live it everyday,\\
Let the broken hearts stand\\
As the price you've gotta pay,\\
We'll keep movin' 'til it's understood,\\
And these badlands start treating us good.\\

Whoa whoa whoa whoa badlands!\\
Whoa whoa whoa whoa badlands!\\
Whoa whoa whoa whoa badlands!\\
Whoa whoa whoa\\

"Sweet Virginia"
\begin{verse}
Wadin' through the waste stormy winter,\\
And there's not a friend to help you through.\\
Tryin' to stop the waves behind your eyeballs,\\
Drop your reds, drop your greens and blues.\\
Thank you for your wine, California,\\
Thank you for your sweet and bitter fruits.\\
Yes I got the desert in my toenail\\
And I hid the speed inside my shoe.\\
I want you to come on, come on down Sweet Virginia,\\
I want you come on, honey child, I beg of you.\\
I want you come on, come on down, you got it in you.\\
(honey child)\\
Got to scrape the shit right off you shoes.\\
But Come on, come on down Sweet Virginia,\\
Come on, honey child, I beg of you.\\
Come on, come on down, you got it in you.\\
(honey child)\\
Got to scrape that shit right off you shoes.\\
But Come on, come on down Sweet Virginia,\\
Come on, honey child, I beg of you.\\
Come on, come on down, you got it in you.\\
(honey child)\\
Got to scrape that shit right off you shoes.\\

Johnny99
\begin{verse}
Well they closed down the auto plant in Mahwah late that month\\
Ralph went out lookin' for a job but he couldn't find none\\ 
He came home too drunk from mixin' 
Tanqueray and wine\\
He got a gun shot a night clerk now they call 'm Johnny 99\\

Down in the part of town where when you hit a red light you don't stop \\
Johnny's wavin' his gun around and threatenin' to blow his top\\
When an off duty cop snuck up on him from behind \\
Out in front of the Club Tip Top they slapped the cuffs on Johnny 99\\

Well the city supplied a public defender but the judge was Mean John Brown \\
He came into the courtroom and stared poor Johnny down \\
Well the evidence is clear gonna let the sentence son fit the crime \\
Prison for 98 and a year and we'll call it even Johnny 99 \\

A fistfight broke out in the courtroom they had to drag Johnny's girl away \\
His mama stood up and shouted "judge don't take my boy this way" \\
Well son you got a statement you'd like to make \\
Before the bailiff comes to forever take you away \\

Now judge I got debts no honest man could pay \\
The bank was holdin' my mortgage and they was takin' my house away \\
Now I ain't sayin' that makes me an innocent man \\
But it was more 'n all this that put that gun in my hand \\

Well your honor I do believe I'd be better off dead \\
And if you can take a man's life for the thoughts that's in his head \\
Then won't you sit back in that chair and think it over judge one more time \\
And let 'em shave off my hair and put me on that execution line\\
\end{verse}
